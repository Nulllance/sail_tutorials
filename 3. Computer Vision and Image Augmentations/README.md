# 3. Computer Vision Basics and Image Augmentation
This tutorial uses opencv, matplotlib, numpy, pillow and skimage, and is run throught jupyter notebooks.
Play around with some of the examples editing different lines of code. 
There are some exercise, fill in code where required, and search any terms that you are not familiar.

## 3.1 Colour Spaces

## 3.2 Convolution
This tutorial briely goes over visulises the convoution opertor.

## 3.3 Image Augmentation
### 3.3.1 AutoAugment and RandAugment
This tutorials covers image augmenations included in the Cubuk et al works [AutoAugement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501) and [RandAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13719). It will cover operations such as shear,
translate, rotate, auto contrast, invert, equalize, solarize, posterize, contrast, color, brightness, and sharpness.

### 3.3.2 Cutout, Mixup and CutMix
This tutorials covers image augmenations included in DeVries and Taylors work [Cutout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552), Zhang et al work [MixUp](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) and Yun et al work [CutMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899).
